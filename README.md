The codes in this repository reproduce the experimental results in "Simulatneous Conformal Prediction for Missing Outcomes with Propensity Score $\epsilon$-Discretization".

functions.R contains the functions used in the experiments, including the functions that run pro-CP and pro-CP2 procedures.

Simulation 1.R and Simulation 2.R reproduce the simulations in Section 4.1.

airfoil.R reproduces the experiment in Section 4.2.

JOBS.R reproduces the experiment in Section 4.3.
