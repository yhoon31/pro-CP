The codes in this repository reproduce the experimental results in "Simultaneous Conformal Prediction for Missing Outcomes with Propensity Score $\epsilon$-Discretization".

The functions used in the experiments, including those that run pro-CP and pro-CP2 procedures, are contained in functions.R.

Simulation1.R and Simulation2.R reproduce the simulations described in Section 4.1 of the paper.

airfoil.R reproduces the experiment detailed in Section 4.2.

JOBS.R reproduces the experiment outlined in Section 4.3.
