The codes in this repository reproduce the experimental results in "Simultaneous Conformal Prediction for Missing Outcomes with Propensity Score $\epsilon$-Discretization".

The functions used in the experiments, including those that run pro-CP and pro-CP2 procedures, are contained in functions.R.

Simulation 1.R, Simulation 2.R, and Simulation 3.R reproduce the simulations described in Section 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and Appendix D of the paper, respectively.

airfoil.R reproduces the experiment detailed in Section 4.2.

JOBS.R reproduces the experiment outlined in Section 4.3.
